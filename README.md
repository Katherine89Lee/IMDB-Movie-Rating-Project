# IMDB Movie Rating Project
 Analysis and visualization of an IMDB movie dataset, possibly to create a recommender system.
 
 The entirety of this project can be viewed and executed in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. 
 
 There are two outcomes for this project that are currently possible. One is a customized analysis of the dataset, and one is a recommender system. So far, I'm a little closer to sussing out a customized analysis idea, but I've never done recommender, so I wouldn't mind trying.
 
 It's possible I could do both. I really would not mind doing both.
